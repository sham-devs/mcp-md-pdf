# After GitHub Push - Next Steps

## âœ… Once Your Push Succeeds

You should see output like:
```
Enumerating objects: XX, done.
Writing objects: 100% (XX/XX), done.
To github.com:sham-devs/mcp-md-pdf.git
 * [new branch]      main -> main
```

## ðŸŽ¯ STEP 2: Create GitHub Environments

GitHub environments are required for PyPI Trusted Publishing.

### Instructions:

1. **Go to repository settings:**
   ```
   https://github.com/sham-devs/mcp-md-pdf/settings/environments
   ```

2. **Create `testpypi` environment:**
   - Click "New environment"
   - Name: `testpypi`
   - Click "Configure environment"
   - No other settings needed (Trusted Publishing handles auth!)
   - Click "Save protection rules" (or just leave the page)

3. **Create `pypi` environment:**
   - Click "New environment"
   - Name: `pypi`
   - Click "Configure environment"
   - No other settings needed
   - Click "Save protection rules"

### âœ… Verification:

You should see two environments listed:
- testpypi
- pypi

---

## ðŸš€ STEP 3: Set Main as Default Branch

1. **Go to:**
   ```
   https://github.com/sham-devs/mcp-md-pdf/settings
   ```

2. **Find "Default branch" section**

3. **Click the switch icon (â‡„) next to the branch name**

4. **Select `main` from dropdown**

5. **Click "Update"**

## ðŸ“‹ STEP 4: Verify Everything Works

### Check Repository:
- Visit: https://github.com/sham-devs/mcp-md-pdf
- README should display with badges
- Actions tab should show workflows ready

### Check Actions Workflows:
- Visit: https://github.com/sham-devs/mcp-md-pdf/actions
- You should see:
  - "Tests" workflow
  - "Publish to PyPI" workflow
  - No runs yet (normal - triggers on push/tag)

---

## ðŸŽ‰ STEP 5: Create Your First Release!

Once environments are set up, you're ready to publish!

### Option A: Quick Test (Recommended First Time)

Test the build without publishing:

```bash
# Install build tools
pip install build twine

# Build the package
python -m build

# Check the package
twine check dist/*
```

You should see:
```
Checking dist/mcp_md_pdf-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl: PASSED
Checking dist/mcp-md-pdf-0.1.0.tar.gz: PASSED
```

### Option B: Publish to PyPI (The Real Thing!)

When you're ready:

```bash
# Create the release tag
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Release v0.1.0: Initial public release

Features:
- Markdown to Word/PDF conversion
- MCP server integration
- Professional styling
- Template support
- Comprehensive test suite
"

# Push the tag (this triggers publishing!)
git push origin v0.1.0
```

### What Happens Next:

1. GitHub Actions workflow starts automatically
2. Package is built
3. Published to TestPyPI first
4. Then published to PyPI
5. You can watch at: https://github.com/sham-devs/mcp-md-pdf/actions

## ðŸ“Š After Publishing

### Verify on TestPyPI:
```
https://test.pypi.org/project/mcp-md-pdf/
```

### Verify on PyPI:
```
https://pypi.org/project/mcp-md-pdf/
```

### Test Installation:
```bash
# Create a test environment
python -m venv test-env
source test-env/bin/activate  # or test-env\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Install from PyPI
pip install mcp-md-pdf

# Test it works
mcp-md-pdf --help
```

---

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### If push fails:
- Check SSH key is added to GitHub
- Try: `ssh -T git@github.com` to test connection

### If environments creation fails:
- Make sure you have admin access to the repository
- Try refreshing the page

### If publishing fails:
- Check GitHub Actions logs
- Verify Trusted Publishing configuration matches exactly
- Ensure environment names are correct (pypi/testpypi)
